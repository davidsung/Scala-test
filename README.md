# Scala-test

## Purpose of this test
This test is intentionally designed to be a small task since we assume not many people have experience with scala. This task helps you get familiar with scala syntax. Just give it a try to implement the function `ParallelSumImpl.sum`.  And try to make sense of how this example works. We will talk further about the solution you provide us. Most importantly, have fun with the task !

## Commamds
* `sbt test` run test cases
* `sbt run` run main class
